Notes about lucene-solr source package
--------------------------------------

The Lucene and Solr projects merged and now release in lock-step from the
same source code repository.

Instead of using the separate tar.gz files for each project as published by
upstream, a single source package generated from the VCS tag associated with
each release is preferred as it simplifies the build process and ensures that
lucene and solr are always at matched compatible layers with each other.
