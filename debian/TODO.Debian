TODO
----
* Work out the bnd issue where it thinks there is a header called "Name".
  Apparently fixed in later versions but the debian package for bnd is very out
  of date.
* Use JFlex to generate Java files included in upstream tarball (needs 1.5 - not
  yet released)
* Javadoc package for solr.
